# MA3DPrints Ops

This repo is the operational brain for MA 3D Prints (planning, tasks, and processes).

## How this repo is used

- **Issues**
  - `Task` issues for small to medium actions (30m–2h).
  - `Project` issues for larger efforts that break down into multiple tasks.

- **Labels**
  - `task` – single, actionable pieces of work.
  - `project` – multi-step efforts.
  - `Website`, `Marketing`, `Operations`, `Customer Work`, `Finance` – area tags.

- **Project Board**
  - GitHub Project: **"MA3DPrints – Operations Board"**
  - Columns:
    - `Inbox` – new ideas / untriaged issues
    - `This Month` – committed focus for the near term
    - `In Progress` – currently being worked on
    - `Waiting / Blocked` – pending customers, materials, payments, etc.
    - `Done` – completed issues

## Workflow

1. When you think of something to do → create an issue.
2. Add it to the `Inbox` column on the project board.
3. During weekly/monthly planning, move selected items to `This Month`.
4. When you start working on something, move it to `In Progress`.
5. If blocked, move it to `Waiting / Blocked` and note what you’re waiting on.
6. When finished, close the issue and move it to `Done`.
