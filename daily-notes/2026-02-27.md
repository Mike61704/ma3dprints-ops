# 2026-02-27 – Session with Jason

## Context

First focused working session on MA 3D Prints + OpenClaw setup.

## New Structures & Boards

- **Repo bootstrapped:** `ma3dprints-ops`
  - Added `README.md` describing how issues + projects are used.
  - Added issue templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
    - `task.md`
    - `project.md`
- **Project boards:**
  - `MA3DPrints – Operations Board` (projects/issues for the 3D printing business).
  - `OpenClaw – Assistant Tasks` (meta work about automation/assistant setup).

## Issues Created (MA3DPrints)

1. `[Project] Improve website lead quality and response speed` (In Progress)
   - Goal: Make it easy for local visitors to understand what MA 3D Prints does and submit enough info to quote quickly.
   - Checklist (high level):
     - Update GoDaddy contact form fields (smarter questions).
     - Add local-focused text above/below the form.
     - Create canned replies for leads with/without files.

2. `[Project] Build a basic print gallery` (Open)
   - Goal: Show real example prints on the site (6–8 items to start).

3. `[Project] Set up and optimize Google Business Profile` (Open)
   - Goal: Improve local discovery for "3D printing New Braunfels" and related searches.

4. `[Task] Save canned reply templates for new leads` (Open)
   - Goal: Store email/text templates so responses are fast and consistent.

All four issues are wired into the `MA3DPrints – Operations Board` via GitHub Projects.

## Social / Marketing Playbook (X / Twitter)

- Created `social/` folder in `ma3dprints-ops`:
  - `social/x-follow-targets.md`
    - Starter list of local/regional + 3D-printing accounts to follow.
  - `social/x-reply-templates.md`
    - Reusable reply templates for:
      - Broken parts / replacement questions
      - General 3D-printing inquiries
      - Local small-biz/community posts
      - Maker / 3D-print showcase posts
  - `social/x-content-ideas.md`
    - Backlog of tweet ideas:
      - Show the work
      - Local angle
      - Tips/educational
      - Behind-the-scenes
- X account actions (manual verification by Mike):
  - Updated profile bio to position MA 3D Prints as a local New Braunfels 3D printing shop for functional parts, prototypes, and toys.
  - Posted and pinned an intro tweet announcing MA 3D Prints and linking to the website (Jason assisted in composing and triggering the post via browser automation).

## Automation / Recurring Tasks

- **Morning recap cron job created** via `openclaw cron add`:
  - Job ID: `c956ef35-71a7-4e52-950d-4a681aa5bf4c`
  - Name: `ma3dprints-morning-recap`
  - Schedule: `0 8 * * *` (08:00 America/Chicago, daily).
  - Target: main session.
  - Payload: system event text `"Run morning recap for MA3DPrints"`.
- Behavior when fired:
  - Jason replies in the main session with:
    - Today’s MA3DPrints focus (tasks/issues).
    - New Braunfels weather (via wttr.in, no API key required).
    - 3D-printing insight/news (uses SearXNG when appropriate, or evergreen tips).
- Verified a manual run of the cron job works end-to-end.

## Search / Weather Infrastructure

- Confirmed **SearXNG** is reachable from OpenClaw at `http://localhost:8088/`.
  - Can be used for generic + 3D-printing news search (JSON API).
- Weather skill wired conceptually via `wttr.in` (no Brave API key required).

## Open Tasks (Not Done Yet)

### High priority (MA3DPrints)

1. **Implement new contact form on GoDaddy** (part of issue #1)
   - Update fields to:
     - Name (required)
     - Email (required)
     - Phone (required)
     - "Do you already have a 3D model file?" (dropdown: has file / needs design / not sure)
     - "What are you looking to print?" (long text)
     - "What matters most to you?" (dropdown: speed / cost / quality / not sure)
     - Material preference (optional)
   - Add above-form text:
     - "Custom 3D printing in New Braunfels – prototypes, replacement parts, toys, and more. Fill out the form below and I’ll get back to you with pricing and timing."
   - Add below-form text:
     - "I usually respond within a few hours during business hours (9am–5pm)."
   - Status: **Not yet implemented in GoDaddy** (requires manual editor work by Mike, guided by Jason).

2. **Create, store, and start using canned replies for new leads** (issue #4)
   - Templates exist in conversation; need to be saved into email client / notes so they are one-click use.
   - Status: **Open**.

3. **Build basic print gallery on website** (issue #2)
   - Take photos of recent prints, select 6–8, add gallery section + captions.
   - Status: **Open**.

4. **Set up/optimize Google Business Profile** (issue #3)
   - Create/claim listing, add website, photos, and request reviews.
   - Status: **Open**.

### Meta / Assistant (OpenClaw – Assistant Tasks)

- Flesh out and use the `OpenClaw – Assistant Tasks` project board for:
  - Future automation ideas.
  - Improvements to Jason’s workflows (e.g., better SearXNG integration scripts).

## Completed / Established Today

- Created and wired the `MA3DPrints – Operations Board` with four initial issues.
- Created the `OpenClaw – Assistant Tasks` GitHub project for assistant/meta work.
- Built out `social/` playbook (targets, replies, content ideas) and committed to git.
- Updated X profile bio and posted a pinned intro tweet for MA 3D Prints.
- Set up and verified a daily cron job for morning recaps.
- Confirmed SearXNG and weather tooling availability.
