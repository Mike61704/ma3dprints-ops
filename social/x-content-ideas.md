# X – Content Ideas for MA 3D Prints

Backlog of tweet ideas. Jason can turn these into full posts on request.

## Show the Work (with photos)

- Replacement appliance knob printed for a local customer.
- Custom bracket for mounting something at home (e.g., router, camera, shelf support).
- Toy / figurine print (especially if it’s recognizable/popular).
- Before/after: broken part vs. 3D printed replacement.
- Time-lapse or short clip of your printer running a job.

## Local Angle

- "If you’re in New Braunfels and have a broken plastic part, there’s a good chance it can be re-printed instead of thrown away."
- "Local pickup in New Braunfels – no need to wait days for shipping on simple 3D prints."
- Highlight a local landmark/object and mention how 3D printing could be used around town.

## Educational / Tips

- Short explanation of what files you need: STL/STEP and rough dimensions.
- How 3D printing can help small businesses (prototypes, jigs, fixtures).
- Differences between materials (PLA vs PETG) in simple language.

## Behind the Scenes

- Photo of your printer setup and a short caption.
- Queue of jobs for the day (“Print queue today: replacement parts + one fun toy print”).
- A small failure/learning moment and what you changed.

**Usage:**
- When you say "Jason, draft a tweet from the ideas list," I’ll pick one of these and turn it into ready-to-post text for your X tab.
- When you complete a relevant job, we can add specifics here and then post.
